# A11Y SPA (Single Page Application)

* Over 4 years ago I created a single page application using Backbone.JS
* Not one consideration for accessibility was made at that time
* The purpose of this SPA is to allow a photographer to upload large images to be transferred to the server for later use (i.e. Custom Dropbox)

## Presentation and Slides
Created for [Inclusive Design 24 2019](https://inclusivedesign24.org/)
